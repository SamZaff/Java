 * In order to find the distance of a falling object in a certain
 * length of time, one must use the equation: 
 *x(t) = 0.5 âˆ— at2 + vit + xi
 * In this example, the object is traveling with an acceleration of
 * -9.8 m/s squared in 15 seconds.  Both the starting position and
 * velocity are 0.
